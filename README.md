## What is this?

This repository contains draft notes about learning, thinking, and creativity,
written in language that students can understand.

## Why?

Many students struggle not because they lack ability,
but because they feel confused, overwhelmed, or unsure how to proceed.
These notes try to describe what actually happens in those moments.

## Collaboration

If you have experience in teaching or education and would like to help
improve clarity or correctness, you are very welcome.
