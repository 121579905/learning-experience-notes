# Learning Experience Notes

This repository is a place to collect and discuss practical observations about learning,
especially from the perspective of students.

I’m interested in questions like:
- Why do students often understand explanations but still feel “stuck”?
- How can teaching reduce unnecessary cognitive or emotional load?
- What kinds of explanations help students regain a sense of control?

This is not a theory paper and not a finished framework.
I’m mainly looking for grounded discussion and practical feedback,
especially from people involved in teaching or learning.

Issues and comments are welcome.
